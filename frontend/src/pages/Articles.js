                    <b>[Nature] Long COVID and kids: more research is urgently needed</b>

                    The article "Long COVID and kids: more research is urgently
                    needed" in nature, the author further research of children’s
                    long COVID is essential because there are not sufficient
                    studies and the children’s positive cases, which are
                    potential children’s long COVID cases, are increasing. About
                    100 million people in the world are predicted to live with
                    long COVID. Even though adolescents were included in some of
                    the previous studies, the samples were too small compared to
                    adult’s samples. Main challenge for initiating the research
                    is specifically on adolescents are collecting data because
                    it requires guardians’ agreements. But researchers should
                    focus on children even more to not allow the younger
                    population left behind.
